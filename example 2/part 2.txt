1. Create a variable x
"
This program demonstrates the key features over Object Oriented Programming; Higher order functions and immutability.
"
2. Create an immutable variable y
"
In F# all variables are immutable. They are set on creation, and can never change again.
You can still change a value after a variable is declared, but you have to explicitly ask for it.
"

3. create a function
    let start = 1
    let limit = 10
    printNumbers(start, limit)
    
...
let rec printNumbers (i:int32, limit:int32) =
    if i < limit then
        printf " %d" i
        let next = i + 1
        printNumbers(next, limit)
    else
        ()
